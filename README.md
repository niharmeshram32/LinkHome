Our application named "LinkHome" is a booking accommodation application that specialises in rental housing.
Our application is focused towards building a strong and diverse culture among group of people by offering them rental property for their vacation mode.
Application workflow and features:

If a user is new to the app, then the user needs to sign up and create an account to add items to wishlist and confirm their booking as required.
If the user already has an account on the application, then the user can directly sign in using the credentials.
User can still view the properties without logging in the app but cannot wishlist the item.
Post login, the user can view a range of beautiful rental properties for their stay along with their description.
If a user likes one or more properties, then the user has the feature to save those for future preference to the wishlist page and view it later on.
The user can also sort the page basis the value of rent, either from high to low or low to high.
The user can also filter the list of records basis their search for example: if a user wants to view all the properties in a particular city with rent less than 300, then it would filter those records.
After filtering, the user can also sort the filter records in ascending or descending values of rent.
Also, if a user wants to know more information about a particular house, then by clicking on the image would navigate to the detailed page of the property.
The user can choose between two different payment options (MasterCard, Paypal) to confirm the booking.
Once the user has clicked on confirmed and if the particular property is a scam, an alert box pops up saying it is a scam, would you still like to make the payment? If a user clicks yes, then the payment is successful.
